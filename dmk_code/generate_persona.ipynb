      "Patient A was a 54-year-old nun who described herself as ‘detail-oriented and perfectionistic.’ She was diagnosed with breast cancer 5 years ago when she visited the hospital for a routine examination. Along with breast cancer, she was also diagnosed with depressed mood and insomnia. When she visited about 6 months ago, her back pain became worse, which subsequently made it more difficult for her to sleep. She initiated treatment in pain control and physical therapy in the Department of Rehabilitation medicine as an outpatient. She was prescribed 10 mg of Zolpidem. Her pain and insomnia improved, but she continued to take sleep medication on an as needed basis. Her main goal for participating in this treatment was discontinuation of her sleep medication.\n",

      "Patient C was a 64-year-old woman who experienced anxiety symptoms. She reported visiting the hospital with main complaints of insomnia which started six years ago when her son got married with the start of frequent and repetitive conflicts with her daughter-in-law. Approximately 2 months ago, she returned to the hospital after arguing with her daughter-in-law, which in turn exacerbated her insomnia. Since then, she has made efforts to reconcile with her daughter-in-law and has also started taking sleep medication, which has somewhat improved her sleep.\n",
      "Patient D was a 46-year-old construction company worker who became nervous and experienced worsening physical symptoms such as headaches under stress.

About 1.5 years ago, he was involved in an automobile accident, which amplified his anxiety and hyperarousal symptoms. He reported that since the accident, he has been experiencing symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder, including severe nightmares.\n",
      "Patient E was a 59-year-old woman who first visited the hospital about two years ago after her brother-in-law failed to return money that she had lent him, leaving her with depression and insomnia. About one year ago, she began to care for her mother-in-law, who had dementia, and the additional stress exacerbated her insomnia. She reported suffering from insomnia almost every night despite taking sleep medication.\n",
